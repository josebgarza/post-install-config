First, we'll start by configuring the roles. Admin Panel > Agents > Roles > Add New Role. Name it "Supreme Admin".
</p>
<br />

Go to Permissions and check all the boxes under Tickets, Tasks, and Knowledgebase to assign the Supreme Admin full control. Add the new role.

Next, we'll configure the departments. Admin Panel > Agents > Departments > Add New Department. Name it "SysAdmins".
</p>
<br />

Now we'll configure the teams. Admin Panel > Agents > Teams > Add New Team > Name it "Online Banking" > Create Team.
</p>
<br />

We're now going to change the settings to allow anyone to create a ticket. This is so that end users that may not have registered in the system may create tickets. Admin Panel > Settings > User Settings (UNCHECK: unregistered users can create tickets). Registration required: Require registration and login to create tickets.
</p>
<br />

Next, we'll configure agents (workers). Admin Panel > Agents > Add New Agent. Create the new agents as Jane (Dept. SysAdmins) and John (Dept. Support). Make note of the usernames and passwords you create for each agent.
</p>
<br />

We will configure the Users now. Agent Panel > Users > Add User. Add Karen.

Next, configure SLA. Admin Panel > Manage > SLA > Add New SLA Plan. We will create 3 SLAs. Sev-A (Grace Period: 1 hour, Schedule: 24/7), Sev-B (Grace Period: 4 hours, Schedule: 24/7), Sev-C (Grace Period: 8 hours, Business Hours)

Finally, we'll configure Help Topics. This is for when users create tickets. Admin Panel > Manage > Help Topics > Add New Help Topic. Create these new help topics: Business Critical Outage, Personal Computer Issues, Equipment Request, Password Reset, Other.

This completes the full setup of osTicket. I hope this guide has been helpful in clarifying the process and assisting you in configuring your system. Itâ€™s highly recommended to practice ticket triaging and resolution.

These are essential skills for any help desk specialist, as they serve as the primary point of contact between a company and its customers when addressing product or service-related issues.
